3. don’t use the author's name to make money or advertise anything.
4. the author dont fucking care that its not open sourced but you should give credit to the original author.
5. free program, dont sell.

**or in another way of explaining**:

you think this license is all serious and shit? 
well, plot twist: it's just a way to say you can do whatever the hell you want with my code, as long as you remember where it came from. 
if you ever feel like using or code this in some crazy-ass way, go for it, but don’t forget to give me a nod. 
and remember, if you try to sell this, you’re an asshole.
and if you used the author's name to make money, you're an asshole too.

enjoy your freedom, have a blast, and fuck off with your genius ideas!
